        <div><h3>I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Portland State University, with an anticipated graduation date in June 2024. Alongside my academic endeavors, I serve as a student ambassador, enhancing my leadership and networking skills. Previously, I held the position of Associate System Engineer at Infosys, where I honed my abilities in effective communication and demonstrated a capacity for rapid adaptation and continuous learning.</h3></div>
        <div><h3>When I'm not engaged in my professional endeavors, you'll often find me indulging in my personal interests, including culinary adventures, hitting the gym, enjoying movies and series. However, one of my greatest joys comes from playing table tennis—I'm always eager to get out there and throw!</h3></div>
